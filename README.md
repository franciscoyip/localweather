# Local Weather project

1. User can see the weather in their current location (if Geolocation is supported, else location will be determined by IP)
2. User can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. User can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Here is the [demo](http://codepen.io/beakerbreak/full/EyQbxa/)
